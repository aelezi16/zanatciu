  Introduction:

<p>Undeniably technology is advancing very fast nowadays and it seems like this pace will not slow down. Various beautiful applications are being built by developers around the world and those applications may be complex or easy depending on the ones who create. On this context the problem is not how fast technology is growing and how easy our developer tools are becoming for us to build a software but the problem is to harmonize the rhythm of our technology development community with the ability to approach different kind of users independently of their abilities to use software. We want to really enhance the quality of their life and not just help them get addicted with our application. Looking from this perspective we will develop an application which will aid tradional professionals or other simple trade jobs to just get connected in a meaningful platform. </p>
